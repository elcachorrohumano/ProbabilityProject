# ProbabilityProject
This project aims to illustrate and analyze various probability distributions and fundamental statistical concepts using the R software. The main tasks include:

- Plotting the density functions of the following distributions and commenting on their shape:
  - Bivariate Normal Distribution
  - Chi-Square Distribution
  - Student's t-Distribution
  - F-Distribution

- Illustrating the Change of Variable Theorem using the t-Student and F distributions.
- Illustrating the convergence in distribution of sequences of random variables towards different limit distributions, such as:
  - Uniform(0,1)
  - Poisson
  - Exponential

- Illustrating the weak law of large numbers using Bernoulli random variables.
- Illustrating the Central Limit Theorem for both continuous and discrete random variables.

The objective of this project is to consolidate the understanding of these theoretical concepts through practical implementation in R and graphical visualization of the results.
